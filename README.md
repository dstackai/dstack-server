## Installation

Installing and running `dstack` is very easy:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --upgrade --no-cache-dir --extra-index-url=https://pypi.org/simple/ dstack==0.6.dev29
dstack server start
```

If you run it for the first time, it may take a while. Once it's done, you'll see the following output:

```bash
To access the application, open this URL in the browser: http://localhost:8080/auth/verify?user=dstack&code=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&next=/

The default profile in "~/.dstack/config.yaml" is already configured. You are welcome to push your applications using Python package.
```

To access `dstack`, click the URL provided in the output. If you try to access `dstack` without using this URL, it will require you to sign up using a username and a password.
## Configuration

If you open the URL, you'll see the following interface:

You'll be logged as the `dstack` user. The page you'll see is `Applications`. It shows you all published applications which you have access to. The sidebar on the left lets you open other pages: `ML Models`, `Settings`, `Documentation`, and `Chat`.

## Minimal Application

Here's an elementary example of using `dstack`. The application takes real-time stock exchange data from Yahoo Finance for the FAANG companies and renders it for a selected symbol.
Here's the Python code that you have to run to make such an application:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

import dstack.controls as ctrl
import dstack as ds
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas_datareader.data as web


def get_chart(symbols: ctrl.ComboBox):
    start = datetime.today() - timedelta(days=30)
    end = datetime.today()
    df = web.DataReader(symbols.value(), 'yahoo', start, end)
    fig = go.Figure(
        data=[go.Candlestick(x=df.index, open=df['Open'], high=df['High'], low=df['Low'], close=df['Close'])])
    return fig


app = ds.app(get_chart, symbols=ctrl.ComboBox(["FB", "AMZN", "AAPL", "NFLX", "GOOG"]))

result = ds.push("faang", app)
print(result.url)
```

If you run it and click the provided URL, you'll see the application:
