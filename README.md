## Installation

Installing and running `dstack` is very easy:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --upgrade --no-cache-dir --extra-index-url=https://pypi.org/simple/ dstack==0.6dev17
dstack server start
```

If you run it for the first time, it may take a while. Once it's done, you'll see the following output:

```bash
To access the application, open this URL in the browser: http://localhost:8080/auth/verify?user=dstack&code=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&next=/

The default profile in "~/.dstack/config.yaml" is already configured. You are welcome to push your applications using Python package.
```

To access `dstack`, click the URL provided in the output. If you try to access `dstack` without using this URL, it will require you to sign up using a username and a password.
## Configuration

For more details on how to install and run `dstack`, please check the [Installation](https://docs.dstack.ai/v/0.6.x/installation) documentation page.

If you open the URL, you'll see the following interface:

You'll be logged as the `dstack` user. The page you'll see is `Applications`. It shows you all published applications which you have access to. The sidebar on the left lets you open other pages: `ML Models`, `Settings`, `Documentation`, and `Chat`.

## Minimal Application

Here's an elementary example of using `dstack`. The application takes real-time stock exchange data from Yahoo Finance for the FAANG companies and renders it for a selected symbol.
Here's the Python code that you have to run to make such an application:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

import dstack.controls as ctrl
import dstack as ds
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas_datareader.data as web


def get_chart(symbols: ctrl.ComboBox):
    start = datetime.today() - timedelta(days=30)
    end = datetime.today()
    df = web.DataReader(symbols.value(), 'yahoo', start, end)
    fig = go.Figure(
        data=[go.Candlestick(x=df.index, open=df['Open'], high=df['High'], low=df['Low'], close=df['Close'])])
    return fig


app = ds.app(get_chart, symbols=ctrl.ComboBox(["FB", "AMZN", "AAPL", "NFLX", "GOOG"], require_apply=False))

result = ds.push("faang", app)
print(result.url)
```

If you run it and click the provided URL, you'll see the application:

### Building dstack from source

#### 1. Set up your environment

dstack is a Spring Boot application written in Kotlin, that bundles a pre-build React application written in JavaScript.
In order to run the entire server with both front-end and back-end together, one must build both React and Spring applications.

In order to build dstack locally, you'll need to have `Java`, `yarn`, and `npm`. Make sure you have them installed locally.

#### 2. Building React application

The code of the React application resides in the folder `website`. This application bundles using [microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) 
the React component that resides in the `dstack-react` folder. The `website` React application consumes the `dstack-react` component by importing `@dstackai/dstack-react`.

Before you can build the `website` React application, you first have to build the `dstack-react` React component by running 
the following command from the folder `dstack-react`:

```bash
$ yarn install && npm run-script build
```

Now, you can build the React application folder by running the following command from the `website`:

```bash
$ yarn install && npm run-script build
```

#### 3. Building Spring Boot application

Before building the Spring Boot application, you first have to copy the pre-built distributive of the React application 
from `website/build` to `server-local-cli/src/main/resources/website`. This can be done by the following Gradle task:

```bash
$ ./gradlew copyWebsite
```

Now, that you've copied the front-end application, you can run the Spring Boot application the following way:

```bash
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

That's it! You're all set ðŸŽ‰ When you do it, you'll see the following output:

```bash
> Task :server-local-cli:bootRun
To access the application, open this URL in the browser: http://localhost:8080/auth/verify?user=dstack&code=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&next=/
```

### Python client package

Note, the source code of the Python client is currently available in a separate [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack-py).
