Push ML models, visualizations, and code to dstack.ai to build data applications in minutes.
No development or deployment skills are required.

How is `dstack` different from other frameworks (Plotly, Streamlit, Shiny, etc):
 - It simplifies the process of creating applications by 
    a) decoupling ML development and application development (by introducing an ML Registry) 
    b) leveraging a declarative approach to defining application components (ML models, datasets, reports, jobs, etc) 
- It is designed for data scientists and doesn't require development skills to build applications.

## How dstack works

The framework consists of the following parts:
- Client packages for Python ([dstack-py](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack-py)). These packages can be used from either notebooks or scripts to push data to dstack.
- A server application ([dstack](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack)). It handles the requests from the Client packages, and offers a registry for ML models, hosts jobs, reports, and data applications. The server can run locally or in Docker.  

A data application is a specific kind of applications that solves domain-specific problems using machine learning, data wrangling, and visualization.

There are several general use-cases for such data science applications:

1. *Reports* â€“ interactive visualizations with different layouts  
2. *Model registry* - Once, you've trained an ML model, you can push it to dstack.ai using the Python's push function. Later, you can pull this model to use anywhere: in a notebook, script, job, or application.
3. *Jobs* â€“ Automate the routine of processing datasets or updating dashboards, by running regular Python and monitoring their progress.
3. *Applications* â€“ Interactive applications that run on the server and let users to interact with ML models and data sources (not supported yet)

Currently, dstack supports *Reports*, *Model registry*, and *Jobs*. The support for *Applications* is coming soon.
    

## Installation

The `dstack` package can be easily installed via either pip or conda:

```bash
pip install dstack
```

The package comes with a command line tool called `dstack`. This command line tool can be used to configure local profiles, credentials, and to run a local server.

The full documentation on how to use dstack, you can find at [docs.dstack.ai](https://docs.dstack.ai).

## Quick start

### Run a server

In order to run a server locally, one must run this command line:

```bash
dstack server start
```

You'll see the following output:

```
To access the dstack server, open one of these URLs in the browser:
		http://localhost:8080/auth/verify?user=dstack&code=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&next=/

If you're using Python, use the following command line command to configure your dstack profile:
	pip install dstack
	dstack config add --token xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx --user dstack --server http://localhost:8080/api
```

Note, in your case instead of `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` you'll see your personal code.

The server by default uses the `8080` port. Optionally, you can specify a custom port by using the command line option `--port`:

```bash
dstack server start --port 8081
```

Note, by default, the server stores all the data under `.dstack` in the user home directory. In case you'd like to store the `.dstack` folder in a different place, use the following command:

```bash
dstack server start --home <other_directory>
```

In this case, the server will store all the data in `<other_directory>/.dstack/`. 

### Configure a user profile

In order to send requests to the locally running server, one must run the command suggested in the output:

```bash
dstack config add --token xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx --user dstack --server http://localhost:8080/api
```

### Push artifacts

Pushing ML models, datasets and visualization to the `dstacl` server is done via the `dstack` packages available for both Python and R. 
    These packages can be used from dstack's *Jobs*, or from Jupyter notebooks, as well as Python scripts and applications.
    
Once data is pushed to the server, it can be accessed via the URL returned in the response, 
    for example `http://localhost:8080/<username>/<stackname>` or via the web application's interface.

The pushed *Stacks* can be combined into interactive *Reports* via the web application's interface.

### Building dstack from source

#### 1. Set up your environment

dstack is a Spring Boot application written in Kotlin, that bundles a pre-build React application written in JavaScript.
In order to run the entire server with both front-end and back-end together, one must build both React and Spring applications.

In order to build dstack locally, you'll need to have `Java`, `yarn`, and `npm`. Make sure you have them installed locally.

#### 2. Building React application

The code of the React application resides in the folder `website`. This application bundles using [microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) 
the React component that resides in the `dstack-react` folder. The `website` React application consumes the `dstack-react` component by importing `@dstackai/dstack-react`.

Before you can build the `website` React application, you first have to build the `dstack-react` React component by running 
the following command from the folder `dstack-react`:

```bash
$ yarn install && npm run-script build
```

Now, you can build the React application folder by running the following command from the `website`:

```bash
$ yarn install && npm run-script build
```

#### 3. Building Spring Boot application

Before building the Spring Boot application, you first have to copy the pre-built distributive of the React application 
from `website/build` to `server-local-cli/src/main/resources/website`. This can be done by the following Gradle task:

```bash
$ ./gradlew copyWebsite
```

Now, that you've copied the front-end application, you can run the Spring Boot application the following way:

```bash
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

That's it! You're all set ðŸŽ‰ When you do it, you'll see the following output:

```bash
> Task :server-local-cli:bootRun
To access the application, open this URL in the browser: http://localhost:8080/auth/verify?user=dstack&code=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&next=/
```
